-- | Number of nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.
--
-- The Show instance displays the TimeStamp as seconds with the nanosecond
-- precision expressed as a decimal amount after the interger, ie:
--
-- >>> t <- getCurrentTimeNanoseconds
-- >>> show t
-- 2014-07-31T23:09:35.274387031Z
--
-- However this doesn't change the fact the underlying representation counts
-- nanoseconds since epoch:
--
-- >>> show $ unTimeStamp t
-- 1406848175274387031
--
-- There is a Read instance that is reasonably accommodating.
--
-- >>> read "2014-07-31T13:05:04.942089001Z" :: TimeStamp
-- 2014-07-31T13:05:04.942089001Z
--
-- >>> read "1406811904.942089001" :: TimeStamp
-- 2014-07-31T13:05:04.942089001Z
--
-- >>> read "1406811904" :: TimeStamp
-- 2014-07-31T13:05:04.000000000Z
--
-- In case you're wondering, the valid range of nanoseconds that fits into the
-- underlying Int64 is:
--
-- >>> show $ minBound :: TimeStamp
-- 1677-09-21T00:12:43.145224192Z
--
-- >>> show $ maxBound :: TimeStamp
-- 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z
--
-- so in a quarter millenium's time, yes, you'll have the Y2262 Problem.
-- Haskell code from today will, of course, still be running, so in the mid
-- Twenty-Third century you will need to replace this implementation with
-- something else.
